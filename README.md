Machine Learning Project for Week 5 - Group Assignment. To run this code clone down the repo and instal required libraries from requirments.txt using pip.
It is recommended to use a venv for these installs. Use the main.py function to execute the tunned model comparison. For cross validation testing for each of the models, go to the model class. All graphs are saved to the "Graphs" folder.
